# Hydration Reminder Program
The Hydration Reminder Program is a Python-based desktop application that reminds you to drink water at regular intervals throughout the day. It calculates the recommended daily water intake based on user input data such as sex, age, weight, height, and pregnancy status (for women), and sends desktop notifications reminding the user to drink water.

## Requirements
To run the program, you'll need:

* Python 3.6 or higher
* The plyer package for sending desktop notifications (install using pip install plyer)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the hydration_reminder.py and water_intake_calculator.py files to your local machine.
2. Open the hydration_reminder.py file and run the script using the following command: python hydration_reminder.py.

The program will ask for user input via an interactive GUI. Once all necessary information is provided, the program will calculate the recommended daily water intake and start sending desktop notifications reminding the user to drink water at regular intervals.
## Customization
The following parameters can be customized in the hydration_reminder.py file:

* Reminder interval: The interval between reminders in seconds.
* Recommended water intake: The recommended daily water intake in milliliters, calculated based on user input data in the water_intake_calculator.py file.

Object-oriented design principles to create a well-structured and maintainable codebase.
## Future Improvements
Integration with fitness tracking devices to track water intake and adjust recommendations accordingly.
Ability to customize reminder messages and intervals.
Integration with mobile devices to send reminders outside of desktop environment.
